<br />
Everyone who makes the journey faces an impossible choice. Hundreds of thousands of people who arrive every year at the US-Mexico border travel far from their homes. An overwhelming share of them come from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, although many migrants come from farther away. Some are fleeing persecution, others crime or hunger. Very often it will not be their first attempt to cross. They may have already been deported from the United States, but it remains their only hope for safety and prosperity. Their homes have become uninhabitable. They will take their chances.<br />
<br />
This vast and unremitting crisis did not spring up overnight. Indeed, as Blitzer dramatizes with forensic, unprecedented reporting, it is the result of decades of misguided policy and sweeping corruption. Brilliantly weaving the stories of Central Americans whose lives have been devastated by chronic political conflict and violence with those of American activists, government officials, and the politicians responsible for the country’s tragically tangled immigration policy, Blitzer reveals the full, layered picture for the first time.<br />
<br />
Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here is an odyssey of struggle and resilience. With astonishing nuance and detail, Blitzer tells an epic story about the people whose lives ebb and flow across the border, and in doing so, he delves into the heart of American life itself. This vital and remarkable story has shaped the nation’s turbulent politics and culture in countless ways—and will almost certainly determine its future. 544 Jonathan Blitzer 1984880802 Brittney 0 Mon, 05 May 2025 01:20:09 -0700 Mon, 05 May 2025 01:20:09 -0700 to-read 4.47 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145624514-everyone-who-is-gone-is-here?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

"I'm in your blood, and you are in mine…"</strong>
<br />
<br />
<strong>
The Netherlands, 1887.</strong>
 Lucy's twin sister Sarah is unwell. She refuses to eat, mumbles nonsensically, and is increasingly obsessed with a centuries-old corpse recently discovered on her husband's grand estate. The doctor has diagnosed her with temporary insanity caused by a fever of the brain. To protect her twin from a terrible fate in a lunatic asylum, Lucy must unravel the mystery surrounding her sister's condition, but it's clear her twin is hiding something. Then again, Lucy is harboring secrets of her own, too.<br />
<br />
Then, the worst happens. Sarah's behavior takes a turn for the strange. She becomes angry… and <em>
hungry</em>
. <br />
<br />
Lucy soon comes to suspect that <em>
something</em>
 is trying to possess her beloved sister. Or is it madness? As Sarah changes before her very eyes, Lucy must reckon with the dark, monstrous truth, or risk losing her forever. 368 Johanna van Veen 1728281571 Brittney 0 Thu, 01 May 2025 19:59:45 -0700 Thu, 01 May 2025 19:59:44 -0700 to-read 3.99 2025 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213570812-blood-on-her-tongue?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Nine children travel with their families to their Grandfather's vacation property, where strange things begin to happen: eyes blink from the bottom up, mushrooms ooze blood, people's faces don't hang right anymore-except they do, once you look more closely. Transformations warp the children's sense of time and place, the very land itself seeming to encroach upon them.<br />
As The Liar watches the children succumb one by one to an unknown fate, she must make sense of absent stars in the night sky, vials of amber liquid that taste of milk, a funny little rope tied in knots. She's faced with a choice: join or resist, only the choice is not so simple.<br />
Set in The Grandfather's Lake House as he continues to extend his property lines and told in the eerie we of the children, Root Rot explores predatory family dynamics, the boundaries of bodies and home, and how individuals choose to participate in or push back against structures that would harm them. 142 Saskia Nislow 1951971256 Brittney 0 Thu, 01 May 2025 14:37:11 -0700 Thu, 01 May 2025 14:37:11 -0700 to-read 3.72 2025 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219874871-root-rot?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Expected to obey the harsh hierarchy of the Reapers who despise her, Ren conceals her emotions and avoids her tormentors as best she can.<br />
<br />
When her failure to control her Shinigami abilities drives Ren out of London, she flees to Japan to seek the acceptance she’s never gotten from her fellow Reapers. Accompanied by her younger brother, the only being on earth to care for her, Ren enters the Japanese underworld to serve the Goddess of Death… only to learn that here, too, she must prove herself worthy. Determined to earn respect, Ren accepts an impossible task—find and eliminate three dangerous Yokai demons—and learns how far she’ll go to claim her place at Death’s side. 393 Kylie Lee Baker 1335405666 Brittney 0 Thu, 01 May 2025 14:36:13 -0700 Thu, 01 May 2025 14:36:12 -0700 to-read 3.62 2021 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56030267-the-keeper-of-night?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Venus, maiden, wife, mother, monster―women have been bound so long by these restrictive roles, codified by patriarchal culture, that we scarcely see them. Catherine McCormack illuminates the assumptions behind these stereotypes whether writ large or subtly hidden. She ranges through Western art―think Titian, Botticelli, and Millais―and the image-saturated world of fashion photographs, advertisements, and social media, and boldly counters these depictions by turning to the work of women artists like Morisot, Ringgold, Lacy, and Walker, who offer alternative images for exploring women’s identity, sexuality, race, and power in more complex ways. 20 illustrations 240 Catherine McCormack 0393542084 Brittney 0 Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:48:32 -0700 Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:48:32 -0700 to-read 4.33 2020 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56769535-women-in-the-picture?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
It’s March of 2019, and twenty-eight-year-old Jules Gold—anxious, artistically frustrated, and internet-obsessed—has been living alone in the apartment she once shared with the man she thought she’d marry when her younger sister Poppy comes to crash. Indefinitely. Poppy is a year out from a suicide attempt only Jules knows about, and as she searches for work and meaning in Brooklyn, Jules spends her days hate-scrolling the feeds of Mormon mommy bloggers and waiting for life to happen.<br />
<br />
Then the hives that’ve plagued Poppy since childhood flare up. Jules’s uterus turns against her. Poppy brings home a maladjusted rescue dog named Amy Klobuchar. The girls’ mother—a newly devout Messianic Jew—starts falling for the same deep-state conspiracy theories as Jules’s online mommies. A trip home to Florida ends in disaster. Amy Klobuchar may or may not have rabies. And Jules struggles halfheartedly to scrape her way to the source of her ennui, slowly and cruelly coming to blame Poppy for her own insufficiencies as a friend, a writer, and a sister. As the year shambles on and a new decade looms near, Jules and Poppy—comrades, competitors, permanent fixtures in each other’s lives—must ask themselves what they want their futures to look like, and whether they’ll spend them together or apart.<br />

<br />
Imagine a Viking, and a certain image springs to a nameless, faceless warrior, leaping ashore from a longboat, and ready to terrorise the hapless local population of a northern European country.<br />
<br />
Yet while such characters define the Viking Age today, they were in the minority. This is the history of all the other people - children, enslaved people, seers, artisans, travellers, writers - who inhabited the medieval Nordic world. Encompassing not just Norway, Denmark and Sweden, but also Iceland, Greenland, parts of the British Isles, Continental Europe and Russia, this is a history of a Viking Age filled with real people of different ages, genders and ethnicities, as told through the traces that they left behind, from hairstyles to place names, love-notes to gravestones.<br />
<br />
For the first time, you can immerse yourself in the day-to-day lives of extraordinary culture which spanned centuries and spread from the edge of the North American continent to the Russian steppes, from the Arctic wastelands to the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic Caliphate. 384 Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough 1324089237 Brittney 0 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:46:26 -0700 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:46:26 -0700 to-read 3.98 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395468-embers-of-the-hands?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

New York Times </i>
bestselling author of <i>
Every Patient Tells a Story, </i>
and an inspiration and adviser for the hit Fox TV drama <i>
House, M.D., </i>
Lisa Sanders has seen it all. And yet she is often confounded by the cases she describes in her column: unexpected collections of symptoms that she and other physicians struggle to diagnose.<br />
<br />
A twenty-eight-year-old man, vacationing in the Bahamas for his birthday, tries some barracuda for dinner. Hours later, he collapses on the dance floor with crippling stomach pains. A middle-aged woman returns to her doctor, after visiting two days earlier with a mild rash on the back of her hands. Now the rash has turned purple and has spread across her entire body in whiplike streaks. A young elephant trainer in a traveling circus, once head-butted by a rogue zebra, is suddenly beset with splitting headaches, as if someone were "slamming a door inside his head."<br />
<br />
In each of these cases, the path to diagnosis--and treatment--is winding, sometimes frustratingly unclear. Dr. Sanders shows how making the right diagnosis requires expertise, painstaking procedure, and sometimes a little luck. Intricate, gripping, and full of twists and turns, <i>
Diagnosis</i>
 puts readers in the doctor's place. It lets them see what doctors see, feel the uncertainty they feel--and experience the thrill when the puzzle is finally solved. 320 Lisa Sanders 0593136632 Brittney 0 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:44:31 -0700 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:44:31 -0700 to-read 3.98 2019 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46064200-diagnosis?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

He draws on cutting-edge research, a surprising cultural history of remembering, and venerable tricks of the mentalist's trade to transform our understanding of human memory.

For two hundred years a noble Venetian family has suffered from an inherited disease that strikes their members in middle age, stealing their sleep, eating holes in their brains, and ending their lives in a matter of months. In Papua New Guinea, a primitive tribe is nearly obliterated by a sickness whose chief symptom is uncontrollable laughter. Across Europe, millions of sheep rub their fleeces raw before collapsing. In England, cows attack their owners in the milking parlors, while in the American West, thousands of deer starve to death in fields full of grass.<br />
<br />
What these strange conditions–including fatal familial insomnia, kuru, scrapie, and mad cow disease–share is their cause: prions. Prions are ordinary proteins that sometimes go wrong, resulting in neurological illnesses that are always fatal. Even more mysterious and frightening, prions are almost impossible to destroy because they are not alive and have no DNA–and the diseases they bring are now spreading around the world.<br />

A fascinating look at dietary differences along class lines, revealing that lack of access to healthy food is far from the primary driver of nutritional inequality in America. </b>
<br />
<br />
Inequality in America manifests in many ways, but perhaps nowhere more than in how we eat. From her years of field research, sociologist and ethnographer Priya Fielding-Singh brings us into the kitchens of dozens of families from varied educational, economic, and ethnoracial backgrounds to explore how—and why—we eat the way we do. We get to know four families intimately: the Bakers, a Black family living below the federal poverty line; the Williamses, a working-class white family just above it; the Ortegas, a middle-class Latinx family; and the Cains, an affluent white family. <br />
<br />
Whether it's worrying about how far pantry provisions can stretch or whether there's enough time to get dinner on the table before soccer practice, all families have unique experiences that reveal their particular dietary constraints and challenges. By diving into the nuances of these families’ lives, Fielding-Singh lays bare the limits of efforts narrowly focused on improving families’ food access. Instead, she reveals how being rich or poor in America impacts something even more fundamental than the food families can afford: these experiences impact the very meaning of food itself.<br />
<br />
Packed with lyrical storytelling and groundbreaking research, as well as Fielding-Singh’s personal experiences with food as a biracial, South Asian American woman, <i>
How the Other Half Eats</i>
 illuminates exactly how inequality starts on the dinner plate. Once you’ve taken a seat at tables across America, you’ll never think about class, food, and public health the same way again.<br />

Here are gripping accounts of unruly molecules and the diseases that form in their wake.<br />
<br />
A college student cannot remember if she has eaten breakfast. By dinner, she is strapped to a hospital bed, convinced she is battling zombies. A man planning to propose marriage instead becomes violently enraged, gripped by body spasms so severe that he nearly bites off his own tongue. One after another, poor farmers in South Carolina drop dead from a mysterious epidemic of dementia.<br />
<br />
With an intoxicating blend of history and intrigue, Sara Manning Peskin invites readers to play medical detective, tracing each diagnosis from the patient to an ailing nervous system. Along the way, Peskin entertains with tales of the sometimes outlandish, often criticized, and forever devoted scientists who discovered it all.<br />
<br />
Peskin never loses sight of the human impact of these conditions. Alzheimer’s Disease is more than the gradual loss of a loved one; it can be a family’s multigenerational curse. The proteins that abound in every cell of our bodies are not simply strings of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon; they are the building blocks of our personalities and relationships. <i>

 is an unputdownable journey into the deepest mysteries of our brains. 214 Sara Manning Peskin 1324002379 Brittney 0 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:32:23 -0700 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:32:23 -0700 to-read 4.17 2022 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58085250-a-molecule-away-from-madness?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
We are surrounded by death. It is in our news, our nursery rhymes, our true-crime podcasts. Yet from a young age, we are told that death is something to be feared. How are we supposed to know what we’re so afraid of, when we are never given the chance to look?<br />
<br />
Fueled by a childhood fascination with death, journalist Hayley Campbell searches for answers in the people who make a living by working with the dead. Along the way, she encounters mass fatality investigators, embalmers, and a former executioner who is responsible for ending sixty-two lives. She meets gravediggers who have already dug their own graves, visits a cryonics facility in Michigan, goes for late-night Chinese with a homicide detective, and questions a man whose job it is to make crime scenes disappear.<br />
<br />
Through Campbell’s incisive and candid interviews with these people who see death every day, she Why would someone choose this kind of life? Does it change you as a person? And are we missing something vital by letting death remain hidden? A dazzling work of cultural criticism, All the Living and the Dead weaves together reportage with memoir, history, and philosophy, to offer readers a fascinating look into the psychology of Western death. 288 Hayley Campbell 1250281849 Brittney 0 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:31:03 -0700 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:31:03 -0700 to-read 4.25 2022 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58724737-all-the-living-and-the-dead?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

It’s so bound up with our deepest feelings that emotional trauma causes it to change shape.<br />
Practising cardiologist Sandeep Jauhar beautifully weaves his own experiences with the defining discoveries of the past to tell the story of our most vital organ. He looks at some of the pioneers who risked their careers and their patients’ lives to better understand the heart. People like Daniel Hale Williams, who performed the world’s first documented heart surgery, and Wilson Greatbatch, who accidentally invented the pacemaker.<br />
Amid gripping scenes from the operating theatre, Jauhar interweaves stories about the patients he’s treated with the moving tale of his family’s own history of heart problems, from his grandfather’s sudden death in India – an event that sparked his life-long obsession – to the ominous signs of how he himself might die.<br />
He also confronts the limits of medical technology and argues that future progress will be determined more by how we choose to live rather than by any device we invent. 269 Sandeep Jauhar 0374168652 Brittney 0 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:30:27 -0700 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:30:27 -0700 to-read 4.05 2018 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37941678-heart?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

In this fascinating journey through the human body and across the globe, Dr. Reisman weaves together stories about our insides with a unique perspective on life, culture, and the natural world.</b>
<br />
<br />
Jonathan Reisman, M.D.―a physician, adventure traveler and naturalist―brings readers on an odyssey navigating our insides like an explorer discovering a new world with <i>
 The Unseen Body </i>
. With unique insight, Reisman shows us how understanding mountain watersheds helps to diagnose heart attacks, how the body is made mostly of mucus, not water, and how urine carries within it a tale of humanity’s origins.<br />
<br />
Through his offbeat adventures in healthcare and travel, Reisman discovers new perspectives on the body: a trip to the Alaskan Arctic reveals that fat is not the enemy, but the hero; a stint in the Himalayas uncovers the boundary where the brain ends and the mind begins; and eating a sheep’s head in Iceland offers a lesson in empathy. By relating rich experiences in far-flung lands and among unique cultures back to the body’s inner workings, he shows how our organs live inextricably intertwined lives―an internal ecosystem reflecting the natural world around us.<br />
<br />
Reisman offers a new and deeply moving perspective, and helps us make sense of our bodies and how they work in a way readers have never before imagined. 224 Jonathan Reisman 1250246628 Brittney 0 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:28:43 -0700 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:28:43 -0700 to-read 3.97 2021 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56268968-the-unseen-body?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
Human bone is versatile and entirely unique: it repairs itself without scarring, it’s lightweight but responds to stresses, and it’s durable enough to survive for millennia. In Bones, orthopedic surgeon Roy A. Meals explores and extols this amazing material that both supports and records vertebrate life.<br />
<br />
Inside the body, bone proves itself the world’s best building material. Meals examines the biological makeup of bones; demystifies how they grow, break, and heal; and compares the particulars of human bone to variations throughout the animal kingdom. In engaging and clear prose, he debunks familiar myths—humans don’t have exactly 206 bones—and illustrates common bone diseases, like osteoporosis and arthritis, and their treatments. Along the way, he highlights the medical innovations—from the first X-rays to advanced operative techniques—that enhance our lives and introduces the giants of orthopedic surgery who developed them.<br />
<br />
After it has supported vertebrate life, bone reveals itself in surprising ways—sometimes hundreds of millions of years later. With enthusiasm and humor, Meals investigates the diverse roles bone has played in human culture throughout history. He highlights allusions to bone in religion and literature, from Adam’s rib to Hamlet’s skull, and uncovers its enduring presence as fossils, technological tools, and musical instruments ranging from the Tibetan thighbone kangling horn to everyday drumsticks. From the dawn of civilization through to the present day, humankind has repurposed bone to serve and protect, and even to teach, amuse, and inspire.<br />
<br />

To the right listener, they tell us all about themselves: where they came from, how they lived, how they died - and who killed them. Forensic scientists can use a corpse, the scene of a crime or a single hair to unlock the secrets of the past and allow justice to be done. <br />
<br />
Bestselling crime author Val McDermid will draw on interviews with top-level professionals to delve, in her own inimitable style, into the questions and mysteries that surround this fascinating science. How is evidence collected from a brutal crime scene? What happens at an autopsy? What techniques, from blood spatter and DNA analysis to entomology, do such experts use? How far can we trust forensic evidence? <br />
<br />
Looking at famous murder cases, as well as investigations into the living - sexual assaults, missing persons, mistaken identity - she will lay bare the secrets of forensics from the courts of seventeenth-century Europe through Jack the Ripper to the cutting-edge science of the modern day. 310 Val McDermid 0802123910 Brittney 0 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:25:57 -0700 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:25:56 -0700 to-read 4.06 2014 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23214337-forensics?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

At the end of the nineteenth century, serial murderer Joseph Vacher, known and feared as "The Killer of Little Shepherds," terrorized the French countryside. He eluded authorities for years--until he ran up against prosecutor Emile Fourquet and Dr. Alexandre Lacassagne, the era's most renowned criminologist. The two men--intelligent and bold--typified the Belle Epoque, a period of immense scientific achievement and fascination with science's promise to reveal the secrets of the human condition. <br />
<br />
With high drama and stunning detail, Douglas Starr revisits Vacher's infamous crime wave, interweaving the story of how Lacassagne and his colleagues were developing forensic science as we know it. We see one of the earliest uses of criminal profiling, as Fourquet painstakingly collects eyewitness accounts and constructs a map of Vacher's crimes. We follow the tense and exciting events leading to the murderer's arrest. And we witness the twists and turns of the trial, celebrated in its day. In an attempt to disprove Vacher's defense by reason of insanity, Fourquet recruits Lacassagne, who in the previous decades had revolutionized criminal science by refining the use of blood-spatter evidence, systematizing the autopsy, and doing groundbreaking research in psychology. Lacassagne's efforts lead to a gripping courtroom denouement. <br />
<br />
"The Killer of Little Shepherds" is an important contribution to the history of criminal justice, impressively researched and thrillingly told. 300 Douglas Starr 0307266192 Brittney 0 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:25:15 -0700 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:25:15 -0700 to-read 3.85 2010 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7893331-the-killer-of-little-shepherds?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

A House With Good Bones</i>
 explores the dark, twisted roots lurking just beneath the veneer of a perfect home and family.</b>
<br />
<br />
<i>
"Mom seems off."</i>
<br />
<br />
Her brother's words echo in Sam Montgomery's ear as she turns onto the quiet North Carolina street where their mother lives alone.<br />
<br />
She brushes the thought away as she climbs the front steps. Sam's excited for this rare extended visit, and looking forward to nights with just the two of them, drinking boxed wine, watching murder mystery shows, and guessing who the killer is long before the characters figure it out.<br />
<br />
But stepping inside, she quickly realizes home isn’t what it used to be. Gone is the warm, cluttered charm her mom is known for; now the walls are painted a sterile white. Her mom jumps at the smallest noises and looks over her shoulder even when she’s the only person in the room. And when Sam steps out back to clear her head, she finds a jar of teeth hidden beneath the magazine-worthy rose bushes, and vultures are circling the garden from above.<br />
<br />
To find out what’s got her mom so frightened in her own home, Sam will go digging for the truth. But some secrets are better left buried. 247 T.

Sly, surprising, and razor-sharp, <i>
Natural Beauty</i>
 follows a young musician into an elite, beauty-obsessed world where perfection comes at a staggering cost.</b>
<br />
<br />
Our narrator produces a sound from the piano no one else at the Conservatory can. She employs a technique she learned from her parents—also talented musicians—who fled China in the wake of the Cultural Revolution. But when an accident leaves her parents debilitated, she abandons her future for a job at a high-end beauty and wellness store in New York City.<br />
 <br />
Holistik is known for its remarkable products and procedures—from remoras that suck out cheap Botox to eyelash extensions made of spider silk—and her new job affords her entry into a world of privilege and a long-awaited sense of belonging. She becomes transfixed by Helen, the niece of Holistik’s charismatic owner, and the two strike up a friendship that hazily veers into more. All the while, our narrator is plied with products that slim her thighs, smooth her skin, and lighten her hair. But beneath these creams and tinctures lies something sinister.<br />
 <br />
A piercing, darkly funny debut, <i>
Natural Beauty</i>
 explores questions of consumerism, self-worth, race, and identity—and leaves readers with a shocking and unsettling truth. 272 Ling Ling Huang 0593472926 Brittney 0 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:05:45 -0700 Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:05:44 -0700 to-read 3.79 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61420120-natural-beauty?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

A diabolical collection of stories featuring achingly human characters whose lives intertwine with ghosts, goblins, and the macabre, by “one of Latin America’s most exciting authors” (Silvia Moreno-Garcia)</b>
<br />
<br />
<i>
On the shores of this river, all the birds that fly, drink, perch on branches, and disturb siestas with the demonic squawking of the possessed—all those birds were once women.</i>
<br />
<br />
Welcome to Argentina and the fascinating, frightening, fantastical imagination of Mariana Enriquez. In twelve spellbinding new stories, Enriquez writes about ordinary people, especially women, whose lives turn inside out when they encounter terror, the surreal, and the supernatural. A neighborhood nuisanced by ghosts, a family whose faces melt away, a faded hotel haunted by a girl who dissolved in the water tank on the roof, a riverbank populated by birds that used to be women—these and other tales illuminate the shadows of contemporary life, where the line between good and evil no longer exists.<br />
<br />
Lyrical and hypnotic, heart-stopping and deeply moving, Enriquez’s stories never fail to enthrall, entertain, and leave us shaken. Translated by the award-winning Megan McDowell, <i>
A Sunny Place for Shady People</i>
 showcases Enriquez’s unique blend of the literary and the horrific, and underscores why Kazuo Ishiguro, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, calls her “the most exciting discovery I’ve made in fiction for some time.” 257 Mariana Enríquez 0593733258 Brittney 0 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:50:28 -0700 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:50:28 -0700 to-read 3.79 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203956643-a-sunny-place-for-shady-people?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

But the dreams—invasive images of blood and brutality—torture her, driving Yeong-hye to purge her mind and renounce eating meat altogether. It’s a small act of independence, but it interrupts her marriage and sets into motion an increasingly grotesque chain of events at home. As her husband, her brother-in-law and sister each fight to reassert their control, Yeong-hye obsessively defends the choice that’s become sacred to her. Soon their attempts turn desperate, subjecting first her mind, and then her body, to ever more intrusive and perverse violations, sending Yeong-hye spiraling into a dangerous, bizarre estrangement, not only from those closest to her, but also from herself. <br />

Celebrated by critics around the world, The Vegetarian is a darkly allegorical, Kafka-esque tale of power, obsession, and one woman’s struggle to break free from the violence both without and within her.</i>

From a psychotherapist, and national advice columnist comes a thought-provoking new book that takes us behind the scenes of a therapist's world -- where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).</b>
<br />
<br />
 One day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose office she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but.<br />
<br />
 As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients' lives -- a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a twenty-something who can't stop hooking up with the wrong guys -- she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell.<br />
<br />
 With startling wisdom and humor, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change.<br />
<br />
<i>
Maybe You Should Talk to Someone </i>
is revolutionary in its candor, offering a deeply personal yet universal tour of our hearts and minds and providing the rarest of gifts: a boldly revealing portrait of what it means to be human, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious lives and our power to transform them. 415 Lori Gottlieb 1328662055 Brittney 0 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:32:55 -0700 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:32:55 -0700 to-read 4.36 2019 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37570546-maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

M Train</i>
 begins in the tiny Greenwich Village café where Smith goes every morning for black coffee, ruminates on the world as it is and the world as it was, and writes in her notebook. Through prose that shifts fluidly between dreams and reality, past and present, we travel to Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul in Mexico; to the fertile moon terrain of Iceland; to a ramshackle seaside bungalow in New York's Far Rockaway that Smith acquires just before Hurricane Sandy hits; to the West 4th Street subway station, filled with the sounds of the Velvet Underground after the death of Lou Reed; and to the graves of Genet, Plath, Rimbaud, and Mishima.<br />
<br />
Woven throughout are reflections on the writer's craft and on artistic creation. Here, too, are singular memories of Smith's life in Michigan and the irremediable loss of her husband, Fred Sonic Smith.<br />
<br />
Braiding despair with hope and consolation, illustrated with her signature Polaroids, <i>
M Train</i>
 is a meditation on travel, detective shows, literature, and coffee. It is a powerful, deeply moving book by one of the most remarkable multiplatform artists at work today. 256 Patti Smith 1101875100 Brittney 0 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:19:38 -0700 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:19:37 -0700 to-read 4.00 2015 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24728470-m-train?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Keiko has never fit in, neither in her family, nor in school, but when at the age of eighteen she begins working at the Hiiromachi branch of “Smile Mart,” she finds peace and purpose in her life. In the store, unlike anywhere else, she understands the rules of social interaction ― many are laid out line by line in the store’s manual ― and she does her best to copy the dress, mannerisms, and speech of her colleagues, playing the part of a “normal” person excellently, more or less. Managers come and go, but Keiko stays at the store for eighteen years. It’s almost hard to tell where the store ends and she begins. Keiko is very happy, but the people close to her, from her family to her coworkers, increasingly pressure her to find a husband, and to start a proper career, prompting her to take desperate action…<br />
<br />
A brilliant depiction of an unusual psyche and a world hidden from view, Convenience Store Woman is an ironic and sharp-eyed look at contemporary work culture and the pressures to conform, as well as a charming and completely fresh portrait of an unforgettable heroine. 163 Sayaka Murata Brittney 0 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:12:35 -0700 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:12:34 -0700 to-read 3.70 2016 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38357895-convenience-store-woman?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<i>
Crying in H-Mart</i>
 meets <i>
My Sister, the Serial Killer</i>
 in this feminist psychological horror about the making of a female serial killer from a Korean-American perspective.</b>
<br />
<br />
Ji-won’s life tumbles into disarray in the wake of her appa’s extramarital affair and subsequent departure. Her mother, distraught. Her younger sister, hurt and confused. Her college freshman grades, failing. Her dreams, horrifying… yet enticing.<br />
<br />
In them, Ji-won walks through bloody rooms full of eyes. Succulent blue eyes. Salivatingly blue eyes. Eyes the same shape and shade as George’s, who is Umma’s obnoxious new boyfriend. George has already overstayed his welcome in her family’s claustrophobic apartment. He brags about his puffed-up consulting job, ogles Asian waitresses while dining out, and acts condescending toward Ji-won and her sister as if he deserves all of Umma’s fawning adoration. No, George doesn’t deserve anything from her family. Ji-won will make sure of that.<br />
<br />
For no matter how many victims accumulate around her campus or how many people she must deceive and manipulate, Ji-won’s hunger and her rage deserve to be sated.<br />
<br />
A brilliantly inventive, subversive novel about a young woman unraveling, Monika Kim’s <i>
The Eyes Are the Best Part</i>
 is a story of a family falling apart and trying to find their way back to each other, marking a bold new voice in horror that will leave readers mesmerized and craving more. 278 Monika Kim 1645661237 Brittney 0 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:58:41 -0700 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:58:41 -0700 to-read 3.81 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195703882-the-eyes-are-the-best-part?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

A rich, magical new book on belonging and identity, love and trauma, nature and renewal, from the Booker shortlisted author of <i>
10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World</i>
. </b>
<br />
<br />
Two teenagers, a Greek Cypriot and a Turkish Cypriot, meet at a taverna on the island they both call home. In the taverna, hidden beneath garlands of garlic, chili peppers and creeping honeysuckle, Kostas and Defne grow in their forbidden love for each other. A fig tree stretches through a cavity in the roof, and this tree bears witness to their hushed, happy meetings and eventually, to their silent, surreptitious departures. The tree is there when war breaks out, when the capital is reduced to ashes and rubble, and when the teenagers vanish. Decades later, Kostas returns. He is a botanist looking for native species, but really, he’s searching for lost love. <br />
<br />
Years later a Ficus carica grows in the back garden of a house in London where Ada Kazantzakis lives. This tree is her only connection to an island she has never visited -- her only connection to her family’s troubled history and her complex identity as she seeks to untangle years of secrets to find her place in the world.<br />
<br />
A moving, beautifully written and delicately constructed story of love, division, transcendence, history and eco-consciousness, <i>
The Island of Missing Trees</i>
 is Elif Shafak’s best work yet. 354 Elif Shafak 0241434998 Brittney 0 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:42:55 -0700 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:42:55 -0700 to-read 4.13 2021 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56587382-the-island-of-missing-trees?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

At the elite Catenan Academy, a young fugitive uncovers layered mysteries and world-changing secrets in this new fantasy series by internationally bestselling author of The Licanius Trilogy, James Islington.</b>

 <i>
AUDI. VIDE. TACE.</i>
 </b>
<br />
<br />
The Catenan Republic – the Hierarchy – may rule the world now, but they do not know everything.<br />
<br />
I tell them my name is Vis Telimus. I tell them I was orphaned after a tragic accident three years ago, and that good fortune alone has led to my acceptance into their most prestigious school. I tell them that once I graduate, I will gladly join the rest of civilised society in allowing my strength, my drive and my focus – what they call Will – to be leeched away and added to the power of those above me, as millions already do. As all must eventually do. <br />
<br />
I tell them that I belong, and they believe me.<br />
<br />
But the truth is that I have been sent to the Academy to find answers. To solve a murder. To search for an ancient weapon. To uncover secrets that may tear the Republic apart.<br />
<br />
And that I will never, ever cede my Will to the empire that executed my family. <br />
<br />
To survive, though, I will still have to rise through the Academy’s ranks. I will have to smile, and make friends, and pretend to be one of them and<i>
 win. </i>
Because if I cannot, then those who want to control me, who know my real name, will no longer have any use for me. <br />
<br />
And if the Hierarchy finds out who I truly am, they will kill me. 639 James Islington 1982141190 Brittney 0 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:41:19 -0700 Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:41:19 -0700 to-read 4.60 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58416952-the-will-of-the-many?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Norman Doidge, M.D., traveled the country to meet both the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity and the people whose lives they’ve transformed - people whose mental limitations or brain damage were seen as unalterable. We see a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole, blind people who learn to see, learning disorders cured, IQs raised, aging brains rejuvenated, stroke patients learning to speak, children with cerebral palsy learning to move with more grace, depression and anxiety disorders successfully treated, and lifelong character traits changed. Using these marvelous stories to probe mysteries of the body, emotion, love, sex, culture, and education, Dr. Doidge has written an immensely moving, inspiring book that will permanently alter the way we look at our brains, human nature, and human potential. 427 Norman Doidge 067003830X Brittney 0 Sat, 12 Apr 2025 22:29:31 -0700 Sat, 12 Apr 2025 22:29:30 -0700 to-read 4.18 2007 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/570172.The_Brain_that_Changes_Itself?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Ramachandran is internationally renowned for uncovering answers to the deep and quirky questions of human nature that few scientists have dared to address. His bold insights about the brain are matched only by the stunning simplicity of his experiments -- using such low-tech tools as cotton swabs, glasses of water and dime-store mirrors. In <em>
Phantoms in the Brain,</em>
 Dr. Ramachandran recounts how his work with patients who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream, perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his most notable cases:<br />
<br />
<br />
A woman paralyzed on the left side of her body who believes she is lifting a tray of drinks with both hands offers a unique opportunity to test Freud's theory of denial.<br />
A man who insists he is talking with God challenges us to ask: Could we be "wired" for religious experience?<br />
A woman who hallucinates cartoon characters illustrates how, in a sense, we are all hallucinating, all the time.<br />

Once upon a time, Andrew had cut out his heart and given it to this boy, and he was very sure Thomas had no idea that Andrew would do anything for him. Protect him. Lie for him.<br />
<br />
Kill for him.</i>
<br />
<br />
High school senior Andrew Perrault finds refuge in the twisted fairytales that he writes for the only person who can ground him to reality―Thomas Rye, the boy with perpetually ink-stained hands and hair like autumn leaves. And with his twin sister, Dove, inexplicably keeping him at a cold distance upon their return to Wickwood Academy, Andrew finds himself leaning on his friend even more.<br />
<br />
But something strange is going on with Thomas. His abusive parents have mysteriously vanished, and he arrives at school with blood on his sleeve. Thomas won't say a word about it, and shuts down whenever Andrew tries to ask him questions. Stranger still, Thomas is haunted by something, and he seems to have lost interest in his artwork―whimsically macabre sketches of the monsters from Andrew's wicked stories.<br />
<br />
Desperate to figure out what's wrong with his friend, Andrew follows Thomas into the off-limits forest one night and catches him fighting a nightmarish monster―Thomas's drawings have come to life and are killing anyone close to him. To make sure no one else dies, the boys battle the monsters every night. But as their obsession with each other grows stronger, so do the monsters, and Andrew begins to fear that the only way to stop the creatures might be to destroy their creator... 336 C.G.

How did America cease to be the land of opportunity?</b>
<br />
<br />
We take it for granted that good neighborhoods—with good schools and good housing—are only accessible to the wealthy. But in America, this wasn’t always the case.<br />
<br />
Though for most of world history, your prospects were tied to where you were born, Americans came up with a revolutionary If you didn’t like your lot in life, you could find a better location and reinvent yourself there. Americans moved to new places with unprecedented frequency, and, for two hundred years, that remarkable mobility was the linchpin of American economic and social opportunity.  <br />
<br />
In this illuminating debut, Yoni Appelbaum, historian and journalist for <i>
The Atlantic</i>
, shows us that this idea has been under attack since reformers first developed zoning laws to ghettoize Chinese Americans in nineteenth-century Modesto, California. The century of legal segregation that ensued—from the zoning laws enacted to force Jewish workers back into New York’s Lower East Side to the private-sector discrimination and racist public policy that trapped Black families in Flint, Michigan to Jane Jacobs’ efforts to protect her vision of the West Village—has raised housing prices, deepened political divides, emboldened bigots, and trapped generations of people in poverty. Appelbaum shows us that these problems have a common people can’t move as readily as they used to. They are, in a word, stuck.<br />
<br />
Cutting through more than a century of mythmaking, <i>
Stuck</i>
 tells a vivid, surprising story of the people and ideas that caused our economic and social sclerosis and lays out common-sense ways to get Americans moving again. 320 Yoni Appelbaum 0593449290 Brittney 0 Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:31:28 -0700 Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:31:28 -0700 to-read 4.29 2025 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215805908-stuck?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

An explosive memoir charting one woman’s career at the heart of one of the most influential companies on the planet, <i>
Careless People</i>
 gives you a front-row seat to Facebook, the decisions that have shaped world events in recent decades, and the people who made them.</b>
<br />
<br />
From trips on private jets and encounters with world leaders to shocking accounts of misogyny and double standards behind the scenes, this searing memoir exposes both the personal and the political fallout when unfettered power and a rotten company culture take hold. In a gripping and often absurd narrative where a few people carelessly hold the world in their hands, this eye-opening memoir reveals what really goes on among the global elite.<br />
<br />
Sarah Wynn-Williams tells the wrenching but fun story of Facebook, mapping its rise from stumbling encounters with juntas to Mark Zuckerberg’s reaction when he learned of Facebook’s role in Trump’s election. She experiences the challenges and humiliations of working motherhood within a pressure cooker of a workplace, all while Sheryl Sandberg urges her and others to “lean in.”<br />
<br />
<i>
Careless People</i>
 is a deeply personal account of why and how things have gone so horribly wrong in the past decade—told in a sharp, candid, and utterly disarming voice. A deep, unflinching look at the role that social media has assumed in our lives, <i>
Careless People</i>
 reveals the truth about the leaders of Facebook: how the more power they grasp, the less responsible they become and the consequences this has for all of us. 382 Sarah Wynn-Williams 1250391237 Brittney 0 Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:29:28 -0700 Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:29:28 -0700 to-read 4.29 2025 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223436601-careless-people?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Abundance</i>
 is a once-in-a-generation, paradigm-shifting call to rethink big, entrenched problems that seem mired in systemic from climate change to housing, education to healthcare.<br />
<br />
To trace the global history of the twenty-first century so far is to trace a history of growing unaffordability and shortage. After years of refusing to build sufficient housing, the entire country has a national housing crisis. After years of slashing immigration, we don’t have enough workers. After decades of off-shoring manufacturing, we have a shortage of chips for cars and computers. Despite decades of being warned about the consequences of climate change, we haven’t built anything close to the clean energy infrastructure we need. The crisis that’s clicking into focus now has been building for decades—because we haven’t been building enough.<br />
<br />
<i>
Abundance</i>
 explains that our problems today are not the results of yesteryear’s villains. Rather, one generation’s solutions have become the next generation’s problems. Rules and regulations designed to solve the environmental problems of the 1970s often prevent urban density and green energy projects that would help solve the environmental problems of the 2020s. Laws meant to ensure that government considers the consequences of its actions in matters of education and healthcare have made it too difficult for government to act consequentially. In the last few decades, our capacity to see problems has sharpened while our ability to solve them has diminished.<br />
<br />
Progress requires the ability to see promise rather than just peril in the creation of new ideas and projects, and an instinct to design systems and institutions that make building possible. In a book exploring how can move from a liberalism that not only protects and preserves but also builds, Klein and Thompson trace the political, economic, and cultural barriers to progress and how we can adopt a mindset directed toward abundance, and not scarcity, to overcome them. 304 Ezra Klein 1668023482 Brittney 0 Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:29:08 -0700 Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:29:08 -0700 to-read 4.11 2025 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176444106-abundance?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
The Roaring Twenties--the Jazz Age--has been characterized as a time of Gatsby frivolity. But it was also the height of the uniquely American hate group, the Ku Klux Klan. Their domain was not the old Confederacy, but the Heartland and the West. They hated Blacks, Jews, Catholics and immigrants in equal measure, and took radical steps to keep these people from the American promise. And the man who set in motion their takeover of great swaths of America was a charismatic charlatan named D.C. Stephenson. <br />
<br />
Stephenson was a magnetic presence whose life story changed with every telling. Within two years of his arrival in Indiana, he’d become the Grand Dragon of the state and the architect of the strategy that brought the group out of the shadows – their message endorsed from the pulpits of local churches, spread at family picnics and town celebrations. Judges, prosecutors, ministers, governors and senators across the country all proudly proclaimed their membership. But at the peak of his influence, it was a seemingly powerless woman – Madge Oberholtzer – who would reveal his secret cruelties, and whose deathbed testimony finally brought the Klan to their knees. <br />
<br />
A FEVER IN THE HEARTLAND marries a propulsive drama to a powerful and page-turning reckoning with one of the darkest threads in American history. 432 Timothy Egan 0735225265 Brittney 0 Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:28:22 -0700 Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:28:22 -0700 to-read 4.33 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61423989-a-fever-in-the-heartland?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

People</i>
) of a novel about new friendships, old loves, and the very human desire to leave a mark on the world.<br />
<br />
With her remarkable insight into the human condition and silences that contain multitudes, Elizabeth Strout returns to the town of Crosby, Maine, and to her beloved cast of characters—Lucy Barton, Olive Kitteridge, Bob Burgess, and more—as they deal with a shocking crime in their midst, fall in love and yet choose to be apart, and grapple with the question, as Lucy Barton puts it, “What does anyone’s life mean?”<br />
<br />
It’s autumn in Maine, and the town lawyer Bob Burgess has become enmeshed in an unfolding murder investigation, defending a lonely, isolated man accused of killing his mother. He has also fallen into a deep and abiding friendship with the acclaimed writer Lucy Barton, who lives down the road in a house by the sea with her ex-husband, William. Together, Lucy and Bob go on walks and talk about their lives, their fears and regrets, and what might have been. Lucy, meanwhile, is finally introduced to the iconic Olive Kitteridge, now living in a retirement community on the edge of town. They spend afternoons together in Olive’s apartment, telling each other stories. Stories about people they have known—“unrecorded lives,” Olive calls them—reanimating them, and, in the process, imbuing their lives with meaning.<br />
<br />
Brimming with empathy and pathos, <i>
Tell Me Everything</i>
 is Elizabeth Strout operating at the height of her powers, illuminating the ways in which our relationships keep us afloat. As Lucy says, “Love comes in so many different forms, but it is always love.” 326 Elizabeth Strout 0593446097 Brittney 0 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:34:43 -0700 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:34:43 -0700 to-read 3.98 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204811915-tell-me-everything?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

From the author of <i>
Skippy Dies</i>
 comes Paul Murray's <i>
The Bee Sting</i>
, an irresistibly funny, wise, and thought-provoking tour de force about family, fortune, and the struggle to be a good person when the world is falling apart.</b>
<br />
<br />
The Barnes family is in trouble. Dickie’s once-lucrative car business is going under―but rather than face the music, he’s spending his days in the woods, building an apocalypse-proof bunker with a renegade handyman. His wife Imelda is selling off her jewelry on eBay, while their teenage daughter Cass, formerly top of her class, seems determined to binge-drink her way through her final exams. And twelve-year-old PJ is putting the final touches to his grand plan to run away from home.<br />
<br />
Where did it all go wrong? A patch of ice on the tarmac, a casual favor to a charming stranger, a bee caught beneath a bridal veil―can a single moment of bad luck change the direction of a life? And if the story has already been written―is there still time to find a happy ending? 645 Paul Murray 0374600309 Brittney 0 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:33:34 -0700 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:33:33 -0700 to-read 3.92 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62039166-the-bee-sting?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Turn Every Walk into a Game of Detection</b>
<br />
<br />
When writer and navigator Tristan Gooley journeys outside, he sees a natural world filled with clues. The roots of a tree indicate the sun’s direction; the Big Dipper tells the time; a passing butterfly hints at the weather; a sand dune reveals prevailing wind; the scent of cinnamon suggests altitude; a budding flower points south. To help you understand nature as he does, Gooley shares more than 850 tips for forecasting, tracking, and more, gathered from decades spent walking the landscape around his home and around the world. Whether you’re walking in the country or city, along a coastline, or by night, this is the ultimate resource on what the land, sun, moon, stars, plants, animals, and clouds can reveal—if you only know how to look! 416 Tristan Gooley 1615192417 Brittney 0 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:30:55 -0700 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:30:54 -0700 to-read 3.76 2014 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22580996-the-lost-art-of-reading-nature-s-signs?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
Nature is full of surprises: deciduous trees affect the rotation of the Earth, cranes sabotage the production of Iberian ham, and coniferous forests can make it rain. But what are the processes that drive these incredible phenomena? And why do they matter?<br />
<br />
In The Secret Wisdom of Nature, master storyteller and international sensation Peter Wohlleben takes readers on a thought-provoking exploration of the vast natural systems that make life on Earth possible. In this tour of an almost unfathomable world, Wohlleben describes the fascinating interplay between animals and plants and answers such questions as: How do they influence each other? Do lifeforms communicate across species boundaries? And what happens when this finely tuned system gets out of sync? By introducing us to the latest scientific discoveries and recounting his own insights from decades of observing nature, one of the world’s most famous foresters shows us how to recapture our sense of awe so we can see the world around us with completely new eyes. 272 Peter Wohlleben 1771643889 Brittney 0 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:30:51 -0700 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:30:50 -0700 to-read 4.05 2017 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40656946-the-secret-wisdom-of-nature?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
As a child, Nezhukumatathil called many places home: the grounds of a Kansas mental institution, where her Filipina mother was a doctor; the open skies and tall mountains of Arizona, where she hiked with her Indian father; and the chillier climes of western New York and Ohio. But no matter where she was transplanted--no matter how awkward the fit or forbidding the landscape--she was able to turn to our world's fierce and funny creatures for guidance.<br />
<br />
"What the peacock can do," she tells us, "is remind you of a home you will run away from and run back to all your life." The axolotl teaches us to smile, even in the face of unkindness; the touch-me-not plant shows us how to shake off unwanted advances; the narwhal demonstrates how to survive in hostile environments. Even in the strange and the unlovely, Nezhukumatathil finds beauty and kinship. For it is this way with wonder: it requires that we are curious enough to look past the distractions in order to fully appreciate the world's gifts.<br />
<br />
Warm, lyrical, and gorgeously illustrated by Fumi Nakamura, World of Wonders is a book of sustenance and joy. 165 Aimee Nezhukumatathil 1571313656 Brittney 0 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:30:29 -0700 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:30:29 -0700 to-read 4.05 2020 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48615751-world-of-wonders?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

The Overstory</em>
 is a sweeping, impassioned work of activism and resistance that is also a stunning evocation of - and paean to - the natural world. From the roots to the crown and back to the seeds, Richard Powers’s twelfth novel unfolds in concentric rings of interlocking fables that range from antebellum New York to the late twentieth-century Timber Wars of the Pacific Northwest and beyond. There is a world alongside ours—vast, slow, interconnected, resourceful, magnificently inventive, and almost invisible to us. This is the story of a handful of people who learn how to see that world and who are drawn up into its unfolding catastrophe.<br />

With their deadly plants, razor-sharp shears, shady corners, and ready-made burial sites, gardens make an ideal scene for the perfect murder. But the outsize influence that gardens and gardening have had on the mystery genre has been underappreciated. Now, Marta McDowell, a writer and gardener with a near-encyclopedic knowledge of the genre, illuminates the many ways in which our greatest mystery writers, from Edgar Allen Poe to authors on today’s bestseller lists, have found inspiration in the sinister side of gardens.<br />
<br />
From the cozy to the hardboiled, the literary to the pulp, and the classic to the contemporary, Gardening Can Be Murder is the first book to explore the mystery genre’s many surprising horticultural connections. Meet plant-obsessed detectives and spooky groundskeeper suspects, witness toxic teas served in foul play, and tour the gardens—both real and imagined—that have been the settings for fiction’s ghastliest misdeeds. <br />
<br />
A New York Times bestselling author herself, McDowell also introduces us to some of today’s top writers who consider gardening integral to their craft, assuring that horticultural themes will remain a staple of the genre for countless twisting plots to come.   216 Marta McDowell 1643261126 Brittney 0 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:29:17 -0700 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:29:16 -0700 to-read 3.48 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75593881-gardening-can-be-murder?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

In this inspiring culmination of Diana Beresford-Kroeger’s life’s work as botanist, biochemist, biologist and poet of the global forest, she delivers a challenge to us all to dig deeper into the science of forests and the ways they will save us from climate breakdown—and then do our part to plant and protect them.</b>
As the last child in Ireland to receive a full Druidic education, Diana Beresford-Kroeger has brought an unusual and ancient holistic attitude to the science of trees, which has led her to many fresh insights into how closely we are tied to one another and to the natural world. Her influential message is to pay rapt attention to trees, because they are the green heart of the living world. Forests are our lungs, our medicine, our oxygen and the renewal of our soil. Planting the right trees in the right places, protecting the last virgin forests and working to create new ones is our best means to ensure a future for our children and grandchildren on this burning earth.Each of the essays gathered in Our Green Heart show us a slice of the natural world through Diana’s unique lens, illuminating the way our health, individually and as a species, is tied to the health of the forest—a tie we ignore at our peril. She maps the science that still needs to be done—there is so much we don’t know about the ways trees and forests work—but also, eloquently, shows us the path to survival that her own science has revealed, the “bioplan” or blueprint for the connectivity of life in nature. If we realize that even the flowerpot on our doorstep is a natural habitat, and plant it according to its bioplan, we will be aiding and abetting life rather than destroying it. 216 Diana Beresford-Kroeger 1039009794 Brittney 0 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:25:25 -0700 Wed, 26 Mar 2025 22:25:25 -0700 to-read 4.15 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210040073-our-green-heart?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

From #1 New York Times bestselling author Ava Reid comes a reimagining of Lady Macbeth, Shakespeare’s most famous villainess, giving her a voice, a past, and a power that transforms the story men have written for her.</b>
<br />
<br />
The Lady knows the stories: how her eyes induce madness in men. <br />
<br />
The Lady knows she will be wed to the Scottish brute, who does not leave his warrior ways behind when he comes to the marriage bed.  <br />
<br />
The Lady knows his hostile, suspicious court will be a game of strategy, requiring all of her wiles and hidden witchcraft to survive. <br />
<br />
But the Lady does not know her husband has occult secrets of his own. She does not know that prophecy girds him like armor. She does not know that her magic is greater and more dangerous, and that it will threaten the order of the world. <br />
<br />
She does not know this yet. But she will. 295 Ava Reid 0593722566 Brittney 0 Mon, 24 Mar 2025 22:48:49 -0700 Mon, 24 Mar 2025 22:48:49 -0700 to-read 3.46 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202102084-lady-macbeth?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

This task requires empathy while pushing against forces in the industry that are resistant to change. How do you change a system that was never designed to be equitable? How do you change a system that continues to divide communities and cede to the automobile?<br />
<br />
In <i>
Inclusive Transportation: A Manifesto for Repairing Divided Communities</i>
, transportation expert Veronica O. Davis shines a light on the inequitable and often destructive practice of transportation planning and engineering. She calls for new thinking and more diverse leadership to create transportation networks that connect people to jobs, education, opportunities, and to each other.<br />
<br />
<i>
Inclusive Transportation</i>
 is a vision for change and a new era of transportation planning. Davis explains why centering people in transportation decisions requires a great shift in how transportation planners and engineers are trained, how they communicate, the kind of data they collect, and how they work as professional teams. She examines what “equity” means for a transportation project, which is central to changing how we approach and solve problems to create something safer, better, and more useful for all people.<br />
<br />
Davis aims to disrupt the status quo of the transportation industry. She urges transportation professionals to reflect on past injustices and elevate current practice to do the hard work that results in more than an idea and a catchphrase.<br />
<br />
<i>
Inclusive Transportation</i>
 is a call to action and a practical approach to reconnecting and shaping communities based on principles of justice and equity. 151 Veronica O.

The Comfort of Crows</i>
, Margaret Renkl presents a literary devotional: fifty-two chapters that follow the creatures and plants in her backyard over the course of a year. As we move through the seasons—from a crow spied on New Year’s Day, its resourcefulness and sense of community setting a theme for the year, to the lingering bluebirds of December, revisiting the nest box they used in spring—what develops is a portrait of joy and grief: joy in the ongoing pleasures of the natural world, and grief over winters that end too soon and songbirds that grow fewer and fewer. <br />
 <br />
Along the way, we also glimpse the changing rhythms of a human life. Grown children, unexpectedly home during the pandemic, prepare to depart once more. Birdsong and night-blooming flowers evoke generations past. The city and the country where Renkl raised her family transform a little more with each passing day. And the natural world, now in visible flux, requires every ounce of hope and commitment from the author—and from us. For, as Renkl writes, “radiant things are bursting forth in the darkest places, in the smallest nooks and deepest cracks of the hidden world.” <br />
 <br />
With fifty-two original color artworks by the author’s brother, Billy Renkl, <i>
The Comfort of Crows</i>
 is a lovely and deeply moving book from a cherished observer of the natural world. 270 Margaret Renkl 1954118465 Brittney 0 Sat, 01 Mar 2025 15:46:50 -0800 Wed, 28 Feb 2024 07:02:57 -0800 to-read 4.17 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123087784-the-comfort-of-crows?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Much greater than space travel or perhaps even the next revolutionary medical breakthrough, what is at stake is the whole idea of the good life as we have known it.<br />
<br />
Immigration and inequality, globalization and technological disruption, slowing growth and accelerating climate change--these are sources of great anxiety across the world, from New Delhi and Dakar to Paris and Washington, DC. The resources to address these challenges are there--what we lack are ideas that will help us jump the wall of disagreement and distrust that divides us. If we succeed, history will remember our era with gratitude; if we fail, the potential losses are incalculable.<br />
<br />
In this revolutionary book, renowned MIT economists Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo take on this challenge, building on cutting-edge research in economics explained with lucidity and grace. Original, provocative, and urgent, <i>
Good Economics for Hard Times</i>
 makes a persuasive case for an intelligent interventionism and a society built on compassion and respect and show how economics, when done right, can help us solve the thorniest social and political problems of the day. It is an extraordinary achievement, one that shines a light to help us appreciate and understand our precariously balanced world. 417 Abhijit V.

“A magisterial history.”—​Paul Krugman<br />
<br />
Named a Best Book of 2022 by Financial Times * Economist * Fast Company<br />
<br />
Before 1870, humanity lived in dire poverty, with a slow crawl of invention offset by a growing population. Then came a great invention sprinted forward, doubling our technological capabilities each generation and utterly transforming the economy again and again. Our ancestors would have presumed we would have used such powers to build utopia. But it was not so. When 1870–2010 ended, the world instead saw global warming; economic depression, uncertainty, and inequality; and broad rejection of the status quo. <br />
 <br />
Economist Brad DeLong’s Slouching Towards Utopia  tells the story of how this unprecedented explosion of material wealth occurred, how it transformed the globe, and why it failed to deliver us to utopia. Of remarkable breadth and ambition, it reveals the last century to have been less a march of progress than a slouch in the right direction. 624 J.

And he has boiled it down to one key factor: walkability. <br />
 The very idea of a modern metropolis evokes visions of bustling sidewalks, vital mass transit, and a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly urban core. But in the typical American city, the car is still king, and downtown is a place that's easy to drive to but often not worth arriving at.<br />
 Making walkability happen is relatively easy and cheap; seeing exactly what needs to be done is the trick. In this essential new book, Speck reveals the invisible workings of the city, how simple decisions have cascading effects, and how we can all make the right choices for our communities.<br />
 Bursting with sharp observations and real-world examples, giving key insight into what urban planners actually do and how places can and do change, <i>
Walkable City</i>
 lays out a practical, necessary, and eminently achievable vision of how to make our normal American cities great again. 312 Jeff Speck 0374285810 Brittney 0 Fri, 21 Feb 2025 19:27:20 -0800 Fri, 21 Feb 2025 19:27:20 -0800 to-read 4.31 2012 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538794-walkable-city?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

An eminent sociologist and bestselling author offers an inspiring blueprint for rebuilding our fractured society.</b>
<br />
<b>
 </b>
<br />
 We are living in a time of deep divisions. Americans are sorting themselves along racial, religious, and cultural lines, leading to a level of polarization that the country hasn't seen since the Civil War. Pundits and politicians are calling for us to come together, to find common purpose. But how, exactly, can this be done?<br />
<br />
In <i>
Palaces for the People</i>
, Eric Klinenberg suggests a way forward. He believes that the future of democratic societies rests not simply on shared values but on shared spaces: the libraries, childcare centers, bookstores, churches, synagogues, and parks where crucial, sometimes life-saving connections, are formed. These are places where people gather and linger, making friends across group lines and strengthening the entire community. Klinenberg calls this the "social infrastructure" When it is strong, neighborhoods flourish; when it is neglected, as it has been in recent years, families and individuals must fend for themselves.<br />
<br />
Klinenberg takes us around the globe--from a floating school in Bangladesh to an arts incubator in Chicago, from a soccer pitch in Queens to an evangelical church in Houston--to show how social infrastructure is helping to solve some of our most pressing challenges: isolation, crime, education, addiction, political polarization, and even climate change.<br />
<br />
Richly reported, elegantly written, and ultimately uplifting, <i>
Palaces for the People</i>
 urges us to acknowledge the crucial role these spaces play in civic life. Our social infrastructure could be the key to bridging our seemingly unbridgeable divides--and safeguarding democracy. 288 Eric Klinenberg 1524761168 Brittney 0 Fri, 21 Feb 2025 19:26:55 -0800 Fri, 21 Feb 2025 19:26:55 -0800 to-read 3.96 2018 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37707827-palaces-for-the-people?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Investment prices must go up. Housing is shelter. When the price of shelter goes up, people experience distress.<br />
<br />
This is the housing trap. It’s time to escape. In <i>
Escaping the Housing Trap: The Strong Towns Response to the Housing Crisis</i>
, renowned urbanists Charles (Chuck) Marohn and Daniel Herriges introduce a first-of-its-kind discussion of the tension between housing as a financial product and housing as shelter. This is the key insight that’s been missing from the Housing Crisis Conversation; and the insight that can help cities fight back against the crisis from the bottom-up.<br />
<br />
This book offers a serious, yet accessible, history of housing policy in the United States and explains how it led us to this point in time: where we face a market that is rigged against people who, only a few decades ago, could have been homeowners or stable, long-term rentals.<br />
<br />
Only local change, on a neighborhood or city-wide scale, can begin to restore balance to the housing market.<br />
<br />
<i>
Escaping the Housing Trap</i>
 is the must-read resource for everyone with a stake in the future of housing in America—and that means everyone. Readers will find:<br />
<br />
- Discussions of housing as an investment and how the country's neighborhoods are being transformed by the introduction of large amounts of investment<br />
- Explorations of housing as shelter, including discussions of zoning policy and NIMBYism<br />
- A comprehensive overview of the Strong Towns approach to solving the American housing crisis 240 Charles L.

Soft City is about ease and comfort, where density has a human dimension, adapting to our ever-changing needs, nurturing relationships, and accommodating the pleasures of everyday life. How do we move from the current reality in most cites—separated uses and lengthy commutes in single-occupancy vehicles that drain human, environmental, and community resources—to support a soft city approach?<br />
 <br />
In Soft City David Sim, partner and creative director at Gehl, shows how this is possible, presenting ideas and graphic examples from around the globe. He draws from his vast design experience to make a case for a dense and diverse built environment at a human scale, which he presents through a series of observations of older and newer places, and a range of simple built phenomena, some traditional and some totally new inventions.<br />
 <br />
Sim shows that increasing density is not enough. The soft city must consider the organization and layout of the built environment for more fluid movement and comfort, a diversity of building types, and thoughtful design to ensure a sustainable urban environment and society.<br />
 <br />
Soft City begins with the big ideas of happiness and quality of life, and then shows how they are tied to the way we live. The heart of the book is highly visual and shows the building blocks for building types and their organization and orientation; how we can get along as we get around a city; and living with the weather. As every citizen deals with the reality of a changing climate, Soft City explores how the built environment can adapt and respond.<br />
 <br />
Soft City offers inspiration, ideas, and guidance for anyone interested in city building. Sim shows how to make any city more efficient, more livable, and better connected to the environment.<br />

A new way forward for sustainable quality of life in cities of all sizes</b>
<br />
<br />
<i>
Strong Towns: A Bottom-Up Revolution to Build American Prosperity </i>
is a book of forward-thinking ideas that breaks with modern wisdom to present a new vision of urban development in the United States. Presenting the foundational ideas of the Strong Towns movement he co-founded, Charles Marohn explains why cities of all sizes continue to struggle to meet their basic needs, and reveals the new paradigm that can solve this longstanding problem.<br />
<br />
Inside, you'll learn why inducing growth and development has been the conventional response to urban financial struggles--and why it just doesn't work. New development and high-risk investing don't generate enough wealth to support itself, and cities continue to struggle. Read this book to find out how cities large and small can focus on bottom-up investments to minimize risk and maximize their ability to strengthen the community financially and improve citizens' quality of life.<br />
<br />
Develop in-depth knowledge of the underlying logic behind the "traditional" search for never-ending urban growth Learn practical solutions for ameliorating financial struggles through low-risk investment and a grassroots focus Gain insights and tools that can stop the vicious cycle of budget shortfalls and unexpected downturns Become a part of the Strong Towns revolution by shifting the focus away from top-down growth toward rebuilding American prosperity <i>
Strong Towns</i>
 acknowledges that there is a problem with the American approach to growth and shows community leaders a new way forward. The Strong Towns response is a revolution in how we assemble the places we live. 256 Charles L.

With mental healthcare services under increasing pressure, could a better approach to urban design and planning provide a solution? The restrictions faced by city residents around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic has brought home just how much urban design can affect our mental health – and created an imperative to seize this opportunity.<br />
<br />
Restorative Cities explores a new way of designing cities, one which places mental health and wellness at the forefront. Establishing a blueprint for urban design for mental health, it examines a range of strategies – from sensory architecture to place-making for creativity and community – and brings a genuinely evidence-based approach that will appeal to designers and planners, health practitioners and researchers alike - and provide compelling insights for anyone who cares about how our surroundings affect us. Written by a psychiatrist and public health specialist, and an environmental psychologist with extensive experience of architectural practice, this much-needed work will prompt debate and inspire built environment students and professionals to think more about the positive potential of their designs for mental well-being. 272 Jenny Roe 1350112887 Brittney 0 Fri, 21 Feb 2025 19:25:18 -0800 Fri, 21 Feb 2025 19:25:18 -0800 to-read 3.91 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56347426-restorative-cities?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

 <b>
“Tell me a secret, little witch.”</b>
 </i>
<br />
<br />
Marion enjoys her quiet life of solitude in the shadowy woods of the Black Veil, where even the local villagers don’t dare venture. She sells her healing potions at the village market by day and tends to her otherworldly garden by night, caring for her magical bees and furry familiar, Peek, at their cottage.<br />
<br />
Then, one moonlit night, she encounters a devilishly handsome male—with powerful wings, sharp fangs, and high fae-like beauty—shot through with a lethal poisoned arrow.<br />
<br />
Under her healer’s oath, she’s bound by magic to try to save the mysterious stranger. But as she nurses him back to health, she begins to suspect that Lorik Ravael isn’t quite what he seems. He knows too much about the Black Veil, rumored to be the entrance to the Below, a realm of dangerous magic and soulless monsters. Yet she’s drawn to him, bewitched by his luminous eyes, seductive grin, and silver tongue of riddles.<br />
<br />
But as their forbidden desire ignites, she fears Lorik is hiding darker secrets than she imagined—secrets that could cost her a heart she isn’t willing to give.<br />

In the propulsive debut novel from the host of the #1 true crime podcast <i>
Crime Junkie</i>
, a journalist uncovers her hometown’s dark secrets when she becomes obsessed with the unsolved murder of her childhood neighbor—and the disappearance of another girl twenty years later.</b>
<br />
<br />
<i>
You can’t ever know for sure what happens behind closed doors.</i>
<br />
<br />
Everyone from Wakarusa, Indiana, remembers the infamous case of January Jacobs, who was discovered in a ditch hours after her family awoke to find her gone. Margot Davies was six at the time, the same age as January—and they were next-door neighbors. In the twenty years since, Margot has grown up, moved away, and become a big-city journalist. But she’s always been haunted by the feeling that it could’ve been her. And the worst part is, January’s killer has never been brought to justice.<br />
<br />
When Margot returns home to help care for her uncle after he is diagnosed with early-onset dementia, she feels like she’s walked into a time capsule. Wakarusa is exactly how she remembers—genial, stifled, secretive. Then news breaks about five-year-old Natalie Clark from the next town over, who’s gone missing under circumstances eerily similar to January’s. With all the old feelings rushing back, Margot vows to find Natalie and to solve January’s murder once and for all.<br />
<br />
But the police, Natalie’s family, the townspeople—they all seem to be hiding something. And the deeper Margot digs into Natalie’s disappearance, the more resistance she encounters, and the colder January’s case feels. Could January’s killer still be out there? Is it the same person who took Natalie? And what will it cost to finally discover what truly happened that night twenty years ago?<br />
<br />
Twisty, chilling, and intense, <i>
All Good People Here</i>
 is a searing tale that asks: What are your neighbors capable of when they think no one is watching? 312 Ashley Flowers 0593496477 Brittney 0 Tue, 18 Feb 2025 22:43:01 -0800 Tue, 18 Feb 2025 22:43:01 -0800 to-read 3.81 2022 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60142750-all-good-people-here?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Haunted by visions of the Fairy King since childhood, she’s had no choice. Her tattered copy of <i>
Angharad</i>
—Emrys Myrddin’s epic about a mortal girl who falls in love with the Fairy King, then destroys him—is the only thing keeping her afloat. So when Myrddin’s family announces a contest to redesign the late author’s estate, Effy feels certain it’s her destiny. <br />
<br />
But musty, decrepit Hiraeth Manor is an impossible task, and its residents are far from welcoming. Including Preston Héloury, a stodgy young literature scholar determined to expose Myrddin as a fraud. As the two rivals piece together clues about Myrddin’s legacy, dark forces, both mortal and magical, conspire against them—and the truth may bring them both to ruin. 378 Ava Reid 0063211505 Brittney 0 Tue, 18 Feb 2025 22:41:33 -0800 Tue, 18 Feb 2025 22:41:33 -0800 to-read 3.73 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75302266-a-study-in-drowning?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
Tracking the natural beauty that surrounds us, The Backyard Bird Chronicles maps the passage of time through daily entries, thoughtful questions, and beautiful original sketches. With boundless charm and wit, author Amy Tan charts her foray into birding and the natural wonders of the world.<br />
<br />
In 2016, Amy Tan grew overwhelmed by the state of the Hatred and misinformation became a daily presence on social media, and the country felt more divisive than ever. In search of peace, Tan turned toward the natural world just beyond her window and, specifically, the birds visiting her yard. But what began as an attempt to find solace turned into something far greater—an opportunity to savor quiet moments during a volatile time, connect to nature in a meaningful way, and imagine the intricate lives of the birds she admired. 291 Amy Tan 0593536134 Brittney 0 Sat, 15 Feb 2025 13:18:45 -0800 Sat, 15 Feb 2025 13:18:44 -0800 to-read 4.05 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194803881-the-backyard-bird-chronicles?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
As she approaches eighty, what she herself calls old age, Abigail Thomas accepts her new life, quieter than before, no driving, no dancing, mostly sitting in her chair in a sunny corner with three dogs for company—three dogs, vivid memories, bugs and birds and critters that she watches out her window. No one but this beloved, best-selling memoirist, could make so much over what might seem so little.<br />
<br />
Memories fall like confetti, as time contracts, shoots forward, dawdles, and there she is, back in her twenties in Washington Square Park, drinking, having sex with strangers, falling in and out of love, believing in a better world. Whole decades evaporate as she sits in her chair, and a spider takes up residence beside her, who will become her boon companion for the next week.<br />
<br />
Sometimes dread arrives, inhabits her body like a shadow and all she can do is write it away, pay attention to what catches her eye, sticks in her brain. Whatever keeps her in the moment.<br />
<br />
Pull up a chair, have a cup of tea and enter Abigail Thomas's funny, mesmerizing, generous world. 240 Abigail Thomas 1668054655 Brittney 0 Sat, 15 Feb 2025 13:18:05 -0800 Sat, 15 Feb 2025 13:18:04 -0800 to-read 3.94 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/207293744-still-life-at-eighty?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

An unforgettable dark fairy tale that asks, Can love save us from ourselves?</b>
<br />
<br />
Birdie’s keeping it together; of course she is. So she’s a little hungover sometimes, and she has to bring her daughter, Emaleen, to her job waiting tables at an Alaskan roadside lodge, but she’s getting by as a single mother in a tough town. Still, Birdie can remember happier times from her youth, when she was free in the wilds of nature.<br />
<br />
Arthur Neilsen, a soft-spoken and scarred recluse who appears in town only at the change of seasons, brings Emaleen back to safety when she gets lost in the woods. Most people avoid him, but to Birdie he represents everything she’s ever longed for. She finds herself falling for Arthur and the land he knows so well. Against the warnings of those who care about them, Birdie and Emaleen move to his isolated cabin in the mountains on the far side of the Wolverine River.<br />
<br />
It’s just the three of them in the vast black woods, far from roads, telephones, electricity, and outside contact, but Birdie believes she has come prepared. At first, it’s idyllic, but soon Birdie discovers that Arthur is something much more mysterious and dangerous than she could have imagined, and that like the Alaska wilderness, a fairy tale can be as dark as it is beautiful. 306 Eowyn Ivey 0593231023 Brittney 0 Sat, 15 Feb 2025 13:13:08 -0800 Sat, 15 Feb 2025 13:13:08 -0800 to-read 3.69 2025 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213243955-black-woods-blue-sky?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
Judith Potts is seventy-seven years old and blissfully happy. She lives on her own in a faded mansion just outside Marlow, there’s no man in her life to tell her what to do or how much whisky to drink, and to keep herself busy she sets crosswords for The Times newspaper. <br />
<br />
One evening, while out swimming in the Thames, Judith witnesses a brutal murder. The local police don’t believe her story, so she decides to investigate for herself, and is soon joined in her quest by Suzie, a salt-of-the-earth dog-walker, and Becks, the prim and proper wife of the local Vicar.<br />
<br />
Together, they are the Marlow Murder Club.<br />
<br />
When another body turns up, they realise they have a real-life serial killer on their hands. And the puzzle they set out to solve has become a trap from which they might never escape… 340 Robert Thorogood 0008238243 Brittney 0 Sat, 15 Feb 2025 13:11:19 -0800 Sat, 15 Feb 2025 13:11:18 -0800 to-read 3.73 2021 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50576230-the-marlow-murder-club?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Live, laugh, shed blood. <i>
Dexter</i>
 meets Richard Scarry’s <i>
Busy, Busy Town</i>
 in this twisted debut graphic novel.</b>
<br />
<br />
Don’t murder the locals—this is small-town serial killer, upstanding citizen, and adorable brown bear Samantha Strong’s cardinal rule. A sea of potential victims is in the city just beyond the forest, but when you’ve worked as hard as Sam to build a cozy life and a thriving business in a community surrounded by friendly fellow animal folk, warm decor, and the aroma of cedar trees and freshly baked apple pie, the last thing you want is to disturb the peace. So imagine Sam's indignation when one of Woodbrook’s own meets a grisly, mysterious demise. You wouldn’t blame her for doing anything it takes to hunt down her rival before the town self-destructs and Sheriff Patterson starts barking up the wrong tree. 152 Patrick Horvath Brittney 0 Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:44:07 -0800 Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:44:07 -0800 to-read 4.19 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202104245-beneath-the-trees-where-nobody-sees?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

An exquisitely moving story about grief, love, and family—but especially love—from the global phenomenon Sally Rooney.</b>
 <br />
<br />
Aside from the fact that they are brothers, Peter and Ivan Koubek seem to have little in common.<br />
<br />
Peter is a Dublin lawyer in his thirties—successful, competent, and apparently unassailable. But in the wake of their father’s death, he’s medicating himself to sleep and struggling to manage his relationships with two very different women—his enduring first love, Sylvia, and Naomi, a college student for whom life is one long joke.<br />
<br />
Ivan is a twenty-two-year-old competitive chess player. He has always seen himself as socially awkward, a loner, the antithesis of his glib elder brother. Now, in the early weeks of his bereavement, Ivan meets Margaret, an older woman emerging from her own turbulent past, and their lives become rapidly and intensely intertwined.<br />
<br />
For two grieving brothers and the people they love, this is a new interlude—a period of desire, despair, and possibility; a chance to find out how much one life might hold inside itself without breaking. 454 Sally Rooney 0374602638 Brittney 0 Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:43:43 -0800 Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:43:43 -0800 to-read 3.87 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208931300-intermezzo?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
Eliot Stein has traveled the globe in search of remarkable people who are preserving some of our rarest cultural rites. In <i>
Custodians of Wonder: Ancient Customs, Profound Traditions, and the Last People Keeping Them Alive</i>
, Stein introduces readers to a man saving the secret ingredient in Japan's 700-year-old original soy sauce recipe. In Italy, he learns how to make the world's rarest pasta from one of the only women alive who knows how to make it. And in India, he discovers a family rumored to make a mysterious metal mirror believed to reveal your truest self. From shadowing Scandinavia's last night watchman to meeting a 27th-generation West African griot to seeking out Cuba's last official cigar factory “readers” more than a century after they spearheaded the fight for Cuban independence, Stein uncovers an almost lost world.<br />
<br />
Climbing through Peru’s southern highlands, he encounters the last Inca bridge master who rebuilds a grass-woven bridge from the fabled Inca Road System. He befriends a British beekeeper who maintains a touching custom of "telling the bees" important news of the day and crunches through a German forest to find the official mailman of the only tree in the world with its own address – to which countless people all over the world have written in hopes of finding love. These are just some of the last people on Earth still in touch with quickly vanishing rites. Let Eliot Stein introduce you to all of them. 336 Eliot Stein 1250281091 Brittney 0 Wed, 05 Feb 2025 22:12:21 -0800 Wed, 05 Feb 2025 22:12:20 -0800 to-read 4.22 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203579108-custodians-of-wonder?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
There's something about water that attracts and fascinates us. No wonder: it's the most omnipresent subnstance on Earth and, along with air, the primary ingredient for supporting life as we know it. From far, far outside, our planet looks like a blue marble; from deep inside, we ourselves are three-quarters H2O.<br />
<br />
We know instinctively that being near water makes us healthier and happier, reduces stress, and brings us peace. But why? And what might the answer tell us about how we <i>
should</i>
 be living our lives?<br />
<br />
After centuries of asking these questions, we can finally answer them - and those answers are life changing. As Wallace J. Nichols reveals in <i>
Blue Mind</i>
, we are now at the forefront of a wave of neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and medical research that illuminates the phsysiological and brain processes that underlie our transformative connection to water. That research, involving tools like EEGs, MRIs, and fMRIs, is uncovering remarkable truths about water's incredibly powerful, and startlingly profound, effects on our bodies and souls. Drawing on this breakthrough science, and on compelling personal stories from top athletes, leading scientists, military veterans, and gifted artists, Nichols shows precisely how proximity to water can:<br />
<br />
-improve performance in a wide range of fields<br />
-increase calm and diminish anxiety much better than medication<br />
-amplify creativity - artistic and otherwise<br />
-increase generosity and compassion<br />
-increase professional success<br />
-improve our overall health and well-being<br />
-reinforce our connection to the natural world - and one another<br />
<br />
<i>
Blue Mind</i>
 isn't just about oceans, lakes, and rivers. Water's tremendous benefits stretch from the sea to the swimming pool, from a barrier reef to a glass of water - even a fishbowl, photograph, or painting. So no matter where you live on this big blue marble, it's time to get your brain on water. 352 Wallace J. Nichols 0316252085 Brittney 0 Wed, 05 Feb 2025 22:11:31 -0800 Wed, 05 Feb 2025 22:11:31 -0800 to-read 3.70 2014 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18656041-blue-mind?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

For fans of Madeline Miller's <i>
Circe</i>
, a stunning debut following Clytemnestra, the most notorious villainess of the ancient world and the events that forged her into the legendary queen.</b>
<br />
<br />
<i>
As for queens, they are either hated or forgotten. She already knows which option suits her best...</i>
<br />
<br />
You were born to a king, but you marry a tyrant. You stand by helplessly as he sacrifices your child to placate the gods. You watch him wage war on a foreign shore, and you comfort yourself with violent thoughts of your own. Because this was not the first offence against you. This was not the life you ever deserved. And this will not be your undoing. Slowly, you plot.<br />
<br />
But when your husband returns in triumph, you become a woman with a choice.<br />
<br />
Acceptance or vengeance, infamy follows both. So, you bide your time and force the gods' hands in the game of retribution. For you understood something long ago that the others never did.<br />
<br />
If power isn't given to you, you have to take it for yourself.<br />
<br />
<b>
A blazing novel set in the world of Ancient Greece for fans of Jennifer Saint and Natalie Haynes, this is a thrilling tale of power and prophecies, of hatred, love, and of an unforgettable Queen who fiercely dealt out death to those who wronged her.</b>

We live in an age of winners and losers, where the odds are stacked in favour of the already fortunate. Stalled social mobility and entrenched inequality give the lie to the promise that "you can make it if you try". And the consequence is a brew of anger and frustration that has fuelled populist protest, with the triumph of Brexit and election of Donald Trump.<br />
<br />
Michael J. Sandel argues that to overcome the polarized politics of our time, we must rethink the attitudes toward success and failure that have accompanied globalisation and rising inequality. Sandel highlights the hubris a meritocracy generates among the winners and the harsh judgement it imposes on those left behind. He offers an alternative way of thinking about success - more attentive to the role of luck in human affairs, more conducive to an ethic of humility, and more hospitable to a politics of the common good. 272 Michael J.

<br />
“No matter where one starts reading, Devotions offers much to love, from Oliver's exuberant dog poems to selections from the Pulitzer Prize-winning American Primitive, and Dream Work, one of her exceptional collections. Perhaps more important, the luminous writing provides respite from our crazy world and demonstrates how mindfulness can define and transform a life, moment by moment, poem by poem.” —The Washington Post<br />
<br />
“It’s as if the poet herself has sidled beside the reader and pointed us to the poems she considers most worthy of deep consideration.” —Chicago Tribune<br />
<br />
Throughout her celebrated career, Mary Oliver has touched countless readers with her brilliantly crafted verse, expounding on her love for the physical world and the powerful bonds between all living things. Identified as "far and away, this country's best selling poet" by Dwight Garner, she now returns with a stunning and definitive collection of her writing from the last fifty years.<br />
<br />
Carefully curated, these 200 plus poems feature Oliver's work from her very first book of poetry, No Voyage and Other Poems, published in 1963 at the age of 28, through her most recent collection, Felicity, published in 2015. This timeless volume, arranged by Oliver herself, showcases the beloved poet at her edifying best. Within these pages, she provides us with an extraordinary and invaluable collection of her passionate, perceptive, and much-treasured observations of the natural world. 456 Mary Oliver 0399563245 Brittney 0 Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:51:49 -0800 Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:51:49 -0800 to-read 4.58 2017 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34272476-devotions?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
“What looks like magic is simply a part of life we don’t understand yet…”<br />
<br />
When retired math teacher Grace Winters is left a run-down house on a Mediterranean island by a long-lost friend, curiosity gets the better of her. She arrives in Ibiza with a one-way ticket, no guidebook and no plan.<br />
<br />
Among the rugged hills and golden beaches of the island, Grace searches for answers about her friend’s life, and how it ended. What she uncovers is stranger than she could have dreamed. But to dive into this impossible truth, Grace must first come to terms with her past.<br />
<br />
Filled with wonder and wild adventure, this is a story of hope and the life-changing power of a new beginning. 324 Matt Haig 0593489276 Brittney 0 Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:06:29 -0800 Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:06:29 -0800 to-read 3.45 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198281740-the-life-impossible?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
In a small pocket of the city, between the houses of No. 77 and No. 79 on Eastbourne Road, there’s a neglected community garden.<br />
<br />
Once vibrant and welcoming, and a sanctuary for the people when they needed it most, the garden’s gate is firmly closed.<br />
<br />

Some people think foxes are similar to ghosts because we go around collecting <i>

<b>
but nothing could be further than the truth. We are living creatures, just like you, </b>
<b>
only usually better looking . . .</b>
<br />
<br />
Manchuria, 1908.<br />
In the last years of the dying Qing Empire, a courtesan is found frozen in a doorway. Her death is clouded by rumors of foxes, which are believed to lure people by transforming themselves into beautiful women and handsome men. Bao, a detective with an uncanny ability to sniff out the truth, is hired to uncover the dead woman’s identity. Since childhood, Bao has been intrigued by the fox gods, yet they’ve remained tantalizingly out of reach—until, perhaps, now.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a family who owns a famous Chinese medicine shop can cure ailments but can’t escape the curse that afflicts them—their eldest sons die before their twenty-fourth birthdays. When a disruptively winsome servant named Snow enters their household, the family’s luck seems to change—or does it?<br />
<br />
Snow is a creature of many secrets, but most of all she’s a mother seeking vengeance for her lost child. Hunting a murderer, she will follow the trail from northern China to Japan, while Bao follows doggedly behind. Navigating the myths and misconceptions of fox spirits, both Snow and Bao will encounter old friends and new foes, even as more deaths occur.<br />

<br />
Michael is coming undone. Adrift after his wife's departure, he has begun taking himself on long, solitary walks across the English countryside. Becoming ever more reclusive, he’ll do anything to avoid his empty house.<br />
<br />
Marnie, on the other hand, is stuck. Hiding alone in her London flat, she avoids old friends and any reminders of her rotten, selfish ex-husband. Curled up with a good book, she’s battling the long afternoons of a life that feels like it’s passing her by.<br />
<br />
When a persistent mutual friend and some very unpredictable weather conspire to toss Michael and Marnie together on the most epic of ten-day hikes, neither of them can think of anything worse. Until, of course, they discover exactly what they’ve been looking for.<br />
<br />
Michael and Marnie are on the precipice of a bright future . . . if they can survive the journey. 368 David Nicholls 0063394057 Brittney 0 Sun, 12 Jan 2025 15:48:40 -0800 Sun, 12 Jan 2025 15:48:40 -0800 to-read 3.97 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201465867-you-are-here?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

'A book for the modern woman, laced with unflinching, glorious honesty.'</i>
 Zara McDonald and Michelle Andrews, co-founders of Shameless Media<br />
<br />
<i>
'A funny, real interrogation of Australia's body image problem, and a call to arms to dismantle diet culture.'</i>
 Chantelle Otten, author and sexologist<br />
<br />

'A feminist manifesto, a younger millennial gospel, with unparalleled candour and self awareness. I inhaled this book - it's going to be big.'</i>

'I have always known that to be hot is to be powerful. For most of my life, I just took it as the way things are, a fact not worth interrogating since it's so obviously true.'</i>
<br />
<br />
Up until her twenty-fifth birthday, the number one priority in Lucinda Price's life was to look good. She nipped, tucked, cut, plucked, shaved, tanned, crunched, squatted and starved. Then, she broke down.<br />
<br />
<i>
All I Ever Wanted Was To Be Hot</i>
 is a funny, provocative retrospective on the last thirty years of Western beauty standards. From the Pussycat Dolls to Victoria's Secret, <i>
The Girls of the Playboy Mansion</i>
 to Lara Bingle, the media of the 2000s was littered with high profile examples of hotness as the highest form of social currency. Is it any wonder a girl growing up in that era might believe "good looks" were as integral to womanhood as having a pulse?<br />
<br />
With her offbeat humour and incisive cultural commentary, Lucinda tells the unfiltered story of a young woman overcoming an eating disorder, illuminating our enduring obsession with appearance by holding a mirror up to herself, and in turn, all of us.<br />
<br />
A hilarious, insightful deep dive into self image, desirability, pop-culture and power. A sparkling debut by one of Australia's most beloved creators and comedians, Lucinda Price aka Froomes.<br />
<br />

'Brilliant, funny and brutally honest, this is a must-read for anyone trying to navigate through this incredibly complex, image-obsessed age.'</i>

From the bestselling author of <em>
In My Dreams I Hold a Knife</em>
 and <em>
Midnight is the Darkest Hour </em>
comes a chilling, compulsive story of five amateur sleuths, whose hunt for an elusive killer catapults them into danger as the world watches.</strong>
<br />
<br />
<em>
It's the most famous crime in modern history. But only she knows the true story.</em>
<br />
<br />
After the unexpected death of her father, college student Jane Sharp longs for a distraction from her grief. She becomes obsessed with true crime, befriending armchair detectives who teach her how to hunt killers from afar. In this morbid internet underground, Jane finds friendship, purpose, and even glory...<br />
<br />
So when news of the shocking deaths of three college girls in Delphine, Idaho takes the world by storm, and sleuths everywhere race to solve the crimes, Jane and her friends are determined to beat them. But the case turns out to be stranger than anyone expected. Details don't add up, the police are cagey, and there seems to be more media hype and internet theorizing than actual evidence. When Jane and her sleuths take a step closer, they find that every answer only begs more questions. Something's not adding up, and they begin to suspect their killer may be smarter and more prolific than any they've faced before. Placing themselves in the center of the story starts to feel more and more like walking into a trap...<br />
<br />
Told one year after the astounding events that concluded the case and left the world reeling, when Jane has finally decided to break her silence about what really happened, she tells the true story of the Delphine Massacres. And what she has to confess will shock even the most seasoned true crime fans...<br />

A woman inherits a pawnshop where you can sell your regrets, and then embarks on a magical journey when a charming young physicist wanders into the shop, in this dreamlike and enchanting fantasy novel.</b>
<br />
<br />
On a backstreet in Tokyo lies a pawnshop, but not everyone can find it. Most will see a cozy ramen restaurant. And only the chosen ones—those who are lost—will find a place to pawn their life choices and deepest regrets.<br />
<br />
Hana Ishikawa wakes on her first morning as the pawnshop’s new owner to find it ransacked, the shop’s most precious acquisition stolen, and her father missing. And then into the shop stumbles a charming stranger, quite unlike its other customers, for he offers help instead of seeking it.<br />
<br />
Together, they must journey through a mystical world to find Hana’s father and the stolen choice—by way of rain puddles, rides on paper cranes, the bridge between midnight and morning, and a night market in the clouds.<br />
<br />
But as they get closer to the truth, Hana must reveal a secret of her own—and risk making a choice that she will never be able to take back. 384 Samantha Sotto Yambao 0593724992 Brittney 0 Sun, 12 Jan 2025 15:33:46 -0800 Sun, 12 Jan 2025 15:33:45 -0800 to-read 3.79 2025 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211479192-water-moon?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

There’s power in a book…</b>
<br />
 <br />
They call them wayward girls. Loose girls. Girls who grew up too fast. And they’re sent to the Wellwood Home in St. Augustine, Florida, where unwed mothers are hidden by their families to have their babies in secret, give them up for adoption, and most important of all, to forget any of it ever happened.<br />
 <br />
Fifteen-year-old Fern arrives at the home in the sweltering summer of 1970, pregnant, terrified and alone. Under the watchful eye of the stern Miss Wellwood, she meets a dozen other girls in the same predicament. There’s Rose, a hippie who insists she’s going to find a way to keep her baby and escape to a commune. And Zinnia, a budding musician who knows she’s going to go home and marry her baby’s father. And Holly, a wisp of a girl, barely fourteen, mute and pregnant by no-one-knows-who.<br />
 <br />
Everything the girls eat, every moment of their waking day, and everything they’re allowed to talk about is strictly controlled by adults who claim they know what’s best for them. Then Fern meets a librarian who gives her an occult book about witchcraft, and power is in the hands of the girls for the first time in their lives. But power can destroy as easily as it creates, and it’s never given freely. There’s always a price to be paid…and it’s usually paid in blood.<br />

Spanning 3,000 years, from the birth of Minoan Crete to the death of the Julio-Claudian dynasty in Rome, a magisterial new history of the ancient world told, for the very first time, through women.</b>
 <br />
<br />
For centuries, men have been writing histories of antiquity filled with warlords, emperors and kings. But when it comes to incorporating women aside from Cleopatra and Boudica, writers have been more comfortable describing mythical heroines than real ones. <br />
<br />
While Penelope and Helen of Troy live on in the imagination, their real-life counterparts have been relegated to the margins. In <i>
The Missing Thread</i>
, Daisy Dunn inverts this tradition and puts the women of history at the centre of the narrative. <br />
<br />
These pages present Enheduanna, the earliest named author, the poet Sappho and Telesilla, who defended her city from attack. Here is Artemisia, sole female commander in the Graeco-Persian Wars, and Cynisca, the first female victor at the Olympic Games. Cleopatra may be the more famous, but Fulvia, Mark Antony's wife, fought a war on his behalf. Many other women remain nameless but integral. <br />
<br />
Through new examination of the sources combined with vivid storytelling Daisy Dunn shows us the ancient world through fresh eyes, and introduces us to an incredible cast of ancient women, weavers of an entire world. 480 Daisy Dunn 0593299663 Brittney 0 Sun, 12 Jan 2025 15:23:23 -0800 Sun, 12 Jan 2025 15:23:23 -0800 to-read 3.68 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201102381-the-missing-thread?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

Earth is not simply an inanimate planet on which life evolved, but rather a planet that came to life.<br />
<br />
The notion of a living world is one of humanity’s oldest beliefs. Though once scorned by many scientists, the concept of Earth as a vast interconnected living system has gained acceptance in recent decades. Life not only adapts to its surroundings—it also shapes them in dramatic and enduring ways. Over billions of years, life transformed a lump of orbiting rock into our cosmic oasis, breathing oxygen into the atmosphere, concocting the modern oceans, and turning rock into fertile soil. Life is intertwined with Earth’s capacity to regulate its climate and maintain balance.<br />
<br />
To reveal life’s profound influence on the planet, Jabr transports the reader to such extraordinary places as an observatory halfway between the treetops and clouds, an experimental nature reserve in Siberia, and a former gold mine nearly one mile underground. We learn how microbes may have played a role in forming the continents. We discover how plants help keep oxygen levels high enough to support complex life, but not so high that Earth becomes disastrously flammable. We see how termites, elephants, and other animals sculpt the planet’s landmasses; how kelp forests and coral reefs store carbon and buffer ocean acidity; and how bacteria change the weather.<br />
<br />
Humans are one of the most extreme examples of life changing Earth. Through fossil fuel consumption, agriculture, and pollution, humans have radically altered more aspects of the planet in less time than any other species, pushing Earth into a crisis. But we are also in a unique position to understand and protect the planet’s wondrous ecology and self-stabilizing processes. Jabr introduces us to a diverse cast of fascinating characters doing exactly that. Through compelling narrative, evocative descriptions, and lucid explanations, he shows us how Earth became the world we’ve known, how it is rapidly becoming a very different world, and how we will determine what kind of Earth our descendants inherit for millennia to come. 304 Ferris Jabr 0593133978 Brittney 0 Sat, 11 Jan 2025 05:59:28 -0800 Sat, 11 Jan 2025 05:59:27 -0800 to-read 4.17 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200634712-becoming-earth?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
Far from being a lifeless ornament in the sky, the Moon holds the key to some of science’s central questions, and in this fascinating account of our remarkable satellite, award-winning science journalist Rebecca Boyle shows us why it is the secret to our success.<br />
<br />
The Moon stabilizes the Earth’s tilt toward the Sun, creating reliable seasons. The durability of this tilt over millennia stabilizes our climate. The Moon pulls on the ocean, driving the tides. It was these tides that mixed nutrients in the sea, enabling the evolution of complex life and, ultimately, bringing life onto land.<br />
<br />
But the Moon also played a pivotal role in our conceptual development. While the Sun helped humans to mark daily time, hunters and gatherers used the phases of the Moon to count months and years, allowing them to situate themselves in time and plan for the future. Its role in the development of religion—Mesopotamian priests recorded the Moon’s position to make predictions about the Moon god--created the earliest known empirical, scientific observation.<br />
<br />
Boyle deftly reframes the history of scientific discovery through a lunar lens, from Mesopotamia to the present day. Touching on ancient astronomers including Claudius Ptolemy; ancient philosophers from Anaxagoras to Plutarch; the scientific revolution of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler; and the lunar fiction of writers like Jules Verne--which inspired Wernher von Braun, the Nazi rocket scientist who succeeded in landing humans on the Moon--Boyle charts our path with the Moon from the origins of human civilization to the Apollo landings and up to the present.<br />
<br />
Even as astronauts around the world prepare to return to the Moon, opening up new frontiers of discovery, profit, and politics, Our Moon brings the Moon down to Earth. 336 Rebecca Boyle 0593129725 Brittney 0 Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:45:44 -0800 Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:45:44 -0800 to-read 3.88 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/134117265-our-moon?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

A masterful hybrid of nature writing and cultural studies that investigates our connection with deer and invites readers to contemplate the paradoxes of how humans interact with and shape the natural world</b>
<br />
<br />
Deer have been an important part of the world that humans occupy for millennia. They’re one of the only large animals that can thrive in our presence. In the 21st century, our relationship is full of contradictions: We hunt and protect them; we cull them from suburbs while making them an icon of wilderness; we see them both as victims and as pests. But there is no doubt that we have a connection to deer: in mythology and story, in ecosystems biological and digital, in cities and in forests.<br />
<br />
Delving into the historical roots of these tangled attitudes and how they play out in the present, Erika Howsare observes scientists capture and collar fawns; hunters show off their trophies; a museum interpreter teaching American history while tanning a deer hide; an animal-control officer collecting the carcasses of deer killed by sharpshooters; and a woman bottle-raising orphaned fawns in her backyard. As she reports these stories, Howsare’s eye is always on the bigger picture: Why do we look at deer in the ways we do, and what do these animals reveal about human involvement in the natural world? 369 Erika Howsare 1646221354 Brittney 0 Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:45:27 -0800 Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:45:27 -0800 to-read 3.79 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125092587-the-age-of-deer?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

A candid, horrific, and deeply touching new collection of poems about life in Gaza by an award-winning Palestinian poet.</b>
Barely thirty years old, Mosab Abu Toha was already a well-known poet when the current siege of Gaza began. After the Israeli army bombed and destroyed his house, pulverizing a library he had painstakingly built for community use, he and his family fled for their safety. Not for the first time in their lives.  Somehow, amid the chaos, Abu Toha kept writing poems. These are those poems. Uncannily clear, direct, and beautifully tuned, they form one of the most astonishing works of art wrested from wartime. Here are directives for what to do in an air raid; here are lyrics about the poet’s wife, singing to his children to distract them. Huddled in the dark, Toha remembers his grandfather’s oranges, his daughter’s joy in eating them. Moving between glimpses of life in relative peacetime and absurdist poems about surviving in a barely livable occupation, Forest of Noise invites a wide audience into an experience that defies the imagination—even as it is watched live. Abu Toha's poems introduce readers to his extended family, some of them no longer with us. This is an urgent, extraordinary, and arrestingly whimsical book. Searing and beautiful, it brings us indelible art in a time of terrible suffering. 96 Mosab Abu Toha 0593803973 Brittney 0 Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:42:19 -0800 Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:42:19 -0800 to-read 4.73 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211809097-forest-of-noise?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">

<br />
A team of astronauts in the International Space Station collect meteorological data, conduct scientific experiments and test the limits of the human body. But mostly they observe. Together they watch their silent blue planet, circling it sixteen times, spinning past continents and cycling through seasons, taking in glaciers and deserts, the peaks of mountains and the swells of oceans. Endless shows of spectacular beauty witnessed in a single day.<br />
<br />
Yet although separated from the world they cannot escape its constant pull. News reaches them of the death of a mother, and with it comes thoughts of returning home. They look on as a typhoon gathers over an island and people they love, in awe of its magnificence and fearful of its destruction.<br />
<br />
The fragility of human life fills their conversations, their fears, their dreams. So far from earth, they have never felt more part - or protective - of it. They begin to ask, what is life without earth? What is earth without humanity? 207 Samantha Harvey 0802161545 Brittney 0 Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:40:15 -0800 Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:40:15 -0800 to-read 3.55 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123136728-orbital?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss">
